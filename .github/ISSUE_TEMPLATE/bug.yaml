      Before submitting a bug, please test if your issue reproduces using ledmon upstream [README](https://github.com/intel/ledmon/blob/master/README.md).
      It is an open-source project, so we highly encourage you to fix issue yourself
      and to become a contributor.

      If the issue is submitted against compilation, please double check that all
      dependencies listed [here](https://github.com/intel/ledmon?tab=readme-ov-file#1-dependencies)
      are installed.

      Please enable highest log level when collecting logs, it could speed up investigation
      e.g. ledctl --log-level=all locate=/dev/nvme0n1

      If the issue is related to AMD hardware, please care to mention [Nathan Fontenot](https://github.com/nfont) in the description.
